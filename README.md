# DCSC_poster_template
A LaTeX template for posters from the DCSC at TU Delft


## Getting started
You can download this LaTeX document and straight-forwardly adjust it according to your liking. 
There are two templates, namely a generic one and one directed towards wind energy research.
To use the generic template, load the style file with
```
\documentclass[generic]{tudposter}
```
For the wind-energy template, load the style file with
```
\documentclass[wind]{tudposter}
```
The LaTeX document is largely self-explanatory.
